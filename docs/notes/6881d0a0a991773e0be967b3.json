It is widely used for building a variety of applications, from mobile applications to large-scale enterprise systems. One of the core principles behind Java is \"Write Once, Run Anywhere\" (WORA), which means that code written in Java can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This portability is one of the key reasons for Java's popularity."

This allows developers to create modular programs that are easier to manage and maintain. The language also emphasizes code reusability through the use of classes and inheritance."
