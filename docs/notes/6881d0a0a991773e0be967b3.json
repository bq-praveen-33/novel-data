It was designed with the principle of \"write once, run anywhere\" (WORA) in mind, meaning that code written in Java can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This portability is one of Java's key features, contributing to its widespread use in various applications, from web development to enterprise solutions."
