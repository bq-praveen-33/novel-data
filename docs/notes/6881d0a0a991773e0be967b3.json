It is an object-oriented language, which means it is based on the concept of \"objects\" that can contain data and methods. Java is designed to be platform-independent, which is one of its most significant advantages. This is achieved through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which allows Java programs to run on any device that has the JVM installed, regardless of the underlying operating system."

Its object-oriented nature allows developers to create modular programs using \"objects\" that encapsulate both data and methods. One of Java's standout features is its platform independence, facilitated by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that Java applications can run on any device with a compatible JVM, enabling seamless execution across different operating systems. This capability has contributed significantly to Java's popularity in various domains, including web development, enterprise applications, and mobile app development.rogramming lang"
