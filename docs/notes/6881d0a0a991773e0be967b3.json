The principle of \"write once, run anywhere\" (WORA) means that Java code can be written once and executed on any device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This capability is a significant advantage of Java, allowing developers to create applications that are portable across different computing environments without needing to rewrite or modify the code for each specific platform. The JVM interprets the compiled Java code into machine code that can run on the host operating system, facilitating this cross-platform func"
