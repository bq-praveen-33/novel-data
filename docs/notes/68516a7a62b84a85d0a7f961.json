Picture a teacher moving into corporate training, or a journalist stepping into content marketing. At first glance, these shifts might seem drastic, but underneath lies a foundation of skills that easily adapt to new environments. The teacher brings organization, leadership, and public speaking. The journalist offers research prowess, storytelling, and critical thinking. Their experiences don’t go to waste—they become assets."
