Narrow AI, also known as weak AI, is designed to perform a specific task, such as voice recognition or image classification. Examples include virtual assistants like Siri and chatbots used in customer service. General AI, or strong AI, refers to a theoretical form of AI that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply intelligence across a wide range of tasks, similar to a human being."
